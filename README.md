## 🙋🏽‍♂️ About me

I'm from the UK 🇬🇧 I use React, Next.js, JavaScript and am working on full-stack side projects 🧑🏽‍💻 I co-founded a [startup](https://youtu.be/-_7hUF_p2CQ?si=zbxa288yXtgzMOf3) making email accessible for Dyslexia & ADHD 🚀 Previously ran a health tech company, am a [TEDx](https://youtu.be/uRVmXBo_Mf0?si=rJld3Ci7x0fxhjuN) speaker and delivered a talk
at Warwick University on [AI and Accessibility](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dileepa-ranawake_ai-accessibility-neurodiversity-activity-7080591003442655232-2dA-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 🎤 I'm a neurodiversity advocate and love building products that make the world a better place ❤️ I'm interested in how AI is changing the user-interface - particularly how it can make tools more accessible and using AI to enhance education & learning and support mental health 👨🏽‍🏫 When I'm not coding, I love hiking / running in the outdoors 🌳 spending time with my little daughter and skiing ⛷️

## 🌱 I’m learning

Full-stack development via side projects.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on

Projects using AI in education, mental health, healthcare and AI user interfaces. I'm open to remote positions and hybrid roles (can commute to Hull, Leeds, York, London) but preference to remote working. Am looking for internships and junior software engineering positions.
