## 🙋🏽‍♂️ About Me

I'm a UK-based full-stack engineer 🇬🇧 I co-founded a [startup](https://youtu.be/-_7hUF_p2CQ?si=zbxa288yXtgzMOf3) that uses AI to make email accessible for Dyslexia & ADHD 🚀 Previously ran a health tech company, am a [TEDx](https://youtu.be/uRVmXBo_Mf0?si=rJld3Ci7x0fxhjuN) speaker and spoke
at Warwick University on [AI and Accessibility](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dileepa-ranawake_ai-accessibility-neurodiversity-activity-7080591003442655232-2dA-/) 🎤 [Nasa Hackathon Nominee](https://2017.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/ideate-and-create/bring-your-own-solution/teams/eos) 👾 I'm a neurodiversity advocate and love building products that make the world a better place ❤️ I’m interested in how AI is changing the user-interface — particularly how it can make tools more accessible, enhance learning, and support mental health 👨🏽‍🏫 When I'm not coding, I love hiking / running in the outdoors 🌳 spending time with my little daughter and skiing ⛷️
